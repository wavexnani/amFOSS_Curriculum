# Solution Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a Quiz Game that tests general knowledge by presenting users with questions they must answer correctly to progress. The game keeps track of the highest level reached by a player, stored in local storage.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the quiz game.

- CSS: Styling, including background images and font customization.

- JavaScript: Game logic, handling input, updating the display, and storing the highest level.

## Resources Used


- Typing Game Code: The typing game logic served as the foundation for handling user input and progression.

- MDN Web Docs: Used for JavaScript functions and localStorage implementation.

- Stack Overflow: Referenced for event listeners and handling user input validation.

- CSS Tricks: Helped with background image scaling and positioning.

## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience in modifying an existing JavaScript game into a quiz format. By reusing concepts from the typing game, I was able to implement a fully functional quiz game while improving my understanding of JavaScript event handling, and local storage.
